# History

### v5.6.4 (September 16, 2025)

Remove golang.org/x/exp from the list of dependencies, in favor of the "slices"
standard library package. This bumps the minimum supported Go version to 1.23.

### v5.6.3 (August 29, 2025)

The Datadog client should have faster performance, by copying less metric data
before writing it to the socket.

### v5.6.2 (July 10, 2025)

Remove outdated README content and add debugstats examples.

### v5.6.1 (May 29, 2025)

Fix an error in the v5.6.0 release related to metric names with a longer buffer
size.

### v5.6.0 (May 27, 2025)

- In the `datadog` library: invalid characters in metric names, field
names, or tag keys/values will be replaced with underscores. Accents and
other diacritics will be removed (e.g. Ã© will be replaced with 'e').
This change also improves performance of HandleMeasures by about 15-20%.
[#192](https://github.com/segmentio/stats/pull/192)

- External calls to github.com/segmentio/objconv were replaced by imports of
  github.com/segmentio/stats/v5/util/objconv, which is a fork of the library (it
  has since been archived). This allowed to to substantially reduce the surface
  we import.

    - `influxdb`: calls to objconv/json were replaced with
    github.com/segmentio/encoding/json (a library with
    substantially more production experience and test coverage).
    [#193](https://github.com/segmentio/stats/pull/193)

- `prometheus`: Fix a deadlock from concurrent calls to collect() and cleanup().
  Thank you Matthew Hooker for this contribution.
  [#194](https://github.com/segmentio/stats/pull/194)

### v5.5.0 (March 26, 2025)

- Add logic to replace invalid unicode in the serialized datadog payload with '\ufffd'.

### v5.4.0 (February 21, 2025)

- Fix a regression in configured buffer size for the datadog client. Versions
5.0.0 to 5.3.1 would ignore any configured buffer size and use the default value
of 1024. This could lead to smaller than expected writes and contention for the
file handle.

### v5.3.1 (January 2, 2025)

- Fix version parsing logic.

### v5.3.0 (December 19, 2024)

- Add `debugstats` package that can easily print metrics to stdout.

- Fix file handle leak in procstats in the DelayMetrics collector.

### v5.2.0

- `go_version.value` and `stats_version.value` will be emitted the first
time any metrics are sent from an Engine. Disable this behavior by setting
`GoVersionReportingEnabled = false` in code, or setting environment variable
`STATS_DISABLE_GO_VERSION_REPORTING=true`.

### v5.1.0

Add support for publishing stats to Unix datagram sockets (UDS).

### v5.0.0 (Released on September 11, 2024)

In the `httpstats` package, replace misspelled `http_req_content_endoing`
and `http_res_content_endoing` with `http_req_content_encoding` and
`http_res_content_encoding`, respectively. This is a breaking change; any
dashboards or queries that filter on this tag must be updated.
